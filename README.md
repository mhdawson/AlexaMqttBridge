# AlexaMqttBridge

This project/module provides a simple bridge between alexa
and mqtt.  

When you speak to Alexa this project receives and decodes
the https post from Alexa with the information for the
intent.  It then posts the configured message on the
configured topic.  Both the topic and message are
javascript string templates.  

## Installation

Install by running:

```
npm install AlexaMqttBridge
```

or

```
npm install https://github.com/mhdawson/AlexaMqttBridge.git
```

then copy config.json.sample to config.json and fill
in the configuration as required.

In addition, the bridge requires a private key and certificate which is used to support SSL.
The certificate must be issued by a recognized issuer in order
for the Alexa skill to be able to connect to it.  Currently these files must be in the
same file as which `index.js` is located.  These two files must be present:

* `key.pm` - private key associated with the certificate (privkey.pem from let's encrypt)
* `cert.pem` - certificate (fullchain.pem from let's encrypt)

I use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to generate a free certificate.

## Configuration

You will need to create a custom skill and a matching config.json
file for the bridge.

### Alexa skill configuration

You will first need to configure a custom skill at developer.amazon.com
(at least for now) which is beyond the scope of this readme. This section
will only provide some specifics with respect to using a custome skill
with the bridge.

The configuration for the endpoint for the custom skill must be
the url at which this module will be running/responding.  For example:

```
https://alexa.myhost.com/alexa?XXXXXXXXX
```

Where XXXXXX is a secret used to ensure we only accept requests from Alexa.
The portion after ```https://alexa.myhost.com/``` must match the value
you configure for url in config.json as described below.

You will also have to create your interaction module which matches
the intents configured in config.json.  This is my configuration for
the sample config.json:

```

While your custom skill is in test mode you will have to request it using the
form:

```
Alexa ask 'invocationName' XXXX
```

were 'invocationName' is the invocation name you assigned to the custom skill
and XXX is the utterance.

## Bridge Configuration

The bridge configuration includes the following main fields:

* **logging** - if true enables logging.
* **port** - port on which the bridge will listen.
* **url** - url that we expect when a request is received.  Should be unique
  and match that configured for the custom skill.  For example :
  ```
  alexa?auvy612312wdxcfr21123
  ```
* **nossl** - If true, allows the bridge to run without SSL/TLS encryption.
  This is useful in case the bridge is placed behind a reverse proxy capable of 
  performing SSL encryption.
* **mqttServerUrl** - url of the mqtt server to connect to.  This can
  either start with tcp:// or mqtts://. If it starts with mqtts://
  there must be a subdirectory in the lib directory called mqttclient
  which contains ca.cert, client.cert, client.key which contain the
  key and associated certificates for a client which is authorized
  to connect to the mqtt server.
* **intents** - the intents to be bridged to mqtt.  Object with one or more
  fields with the name of each field matching one of the intents configured
  for the skill.  For example ```TurnOn```.  The value for the field
  is then an object with one or more fields, each of which corresponds to a
  device that the intent will act on. For example: ```alarm```.  The value
  for that field is then an object with a topic and message field. The topic
  and message field are javascript templates that will be evaluated in a context
  where the variable 'slots' can be used within the template.  The slots
  variable will have a field for each of the slots configured for the itntent.
  In addition to the topic and message field there can be an optional field
  called responseTopic.  If this field exists then the bridge will wait on
  that topic for the resonse for Alexa to say in response to the command. If
  there is a responseTopic, you can also optionally include the
  responseTimeout field to change the timeout in milliseconds after which the
  bridge will stop waiting for a response (the default is 5000ms).

The folowing is an example matching the skill configuration shown above:

                         "living room right": { "topic": "house/x10", "message": "A,1,1" },

                         "dining room": { "topic": "house/x10", "message": "A,5,1" }
                       },
             "TurnOff": { "power monitor": { "topic": "alexa", "message": "received ${slots.Device.value} off" },

                           },
             "Mute": { "TV": { "topic": "home/harmony/hubs/harmony-hub/devices/samsung-tv/command",
                               "message": "mute" } },
             "Play": { "TV": { "topic": "house/dlnaplay/play",
                               "message": "${slots.Media.value}",
                               "responseTopic": "house/dlnaplay/response" } },
             "UnPause": { "TV": { "topic": "house/dlnaplay/control",
                               "message": "play" } },
             "Pause": { "TV": { "topic": "house/dlnaplay/control",
                               "message": "pause" } },
             "Stop": { "TV": { "topic": "house/dlnaplay/control",
                               "message": "stop" } },
             "Seek": { "TV": { "topic": "house/dlnaplay/control",
                               "message": "seek:${slots.Time.value}" } }
          },
```

In the case of some of the "TV" commands, the topics are setup so that they can control
the TV through this project [harmony-api](https://github.com/maddox/harmony-api).
This is a good illustration of the power of exposing services through mqtt. I
was easily able to add voice control to the harmony hub using an existing project
that provided an mqtt interface.  Similary, voice control was added to my
X10 devices using this project which exposes an mqtt interfce: [micro-app-mqtt-x10-bridge](https://github.com/mhdawson/micro-app-mqtt-x10-bridge).
